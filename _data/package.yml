abstract: <b>Warning:</b> This package is still under development and this version is to be considered a working, but preliminary one. <p/> This package provides a framework to implement group recognition methods in a generic way. In particular, it is suitable for permutation groups, matrix groups, projective groups and blackbox groups. The accompanying <span class="pkgname">recog</span> package contains the necessary methods for actual recognition.
